# Welcome to my Digital Portfolio 

## About Me
This is a paragraph about me. It explains my major at UCF, my career goals, and skills that I have. Even if I haven't worked anywhere that I would consider *in* the field that I'm majoring in, all work experience demonstrates that I can show up on time, communicate with supervisors, work with co-workers, etc. If you work in hospitality, you already work in a fast-paced environment! Retail? You've got great communication and customer service skills. Think about the things you do at work, and how those skills can be used in your dream job!

*Note: this can be written in first person (I, me) or in third person. This is helpful if you use nonbinary pronouns or have a name that isn't easy for most people to discern gender, like Jamie, Alex, etc.
