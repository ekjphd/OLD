# Welcome to the Sample Portfolio Repository
 
## Note
I have this set up for someone who is new to Github and is using it in their browser. If you are familiar with Github, feel free to use your own site organization, theme, css, etc.

Click through the sample [website](https://ekjphd.github.io/ENC4265/) and see how to organize your assignments for this course.

## Why Github?
This is just one more skill that can help you stand out in the job market! There is a big push for technical documents to be treated as code--and even to write them in the same software as code--for software and technical companies. Plus, Github pages use **Markdown**, which is another impressive skill for your resume.

## Basics
- [Fork (copy) and edit this whole repository](https://github.com/ekjphd/ENC4265/new/main#how-to-fork-copy-this-repository), then you can just update the content with your own work, creating your own portfolio!
- index.md = your home page
- You can edit the markdown files directly on GitHub.
- **Commit changes...** means **save**. Don't forget to save!
- Preview is a great way to check before saving.
- After you click "commit changes..." it will ask you to describe your changes. It will auto-fill this, so feel free to just hit "commit changes" and not worry about notes about what you did.
- Make **any changes you'd like** to show off your skills with Markdown and coding!
